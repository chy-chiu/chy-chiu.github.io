Roberta has been admitted from the emergency department (ED) to the the medical ward. At presentation to the ED, Roberta underwent a chest X-ray that showed pulmonary oedema. Blood tests revealed that cardiac enzymes were within normal limits and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was unchanged when compared to her last recording. Roberta’s medical records indicate an echocardiogram performed 12 months ago showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 40%, increased systolic and diastolic volumes, and ventricular and atrial enlargement consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. Ischaemic heart disease is thought to be the underlying cause of Roberta’s cardiomyopathy. Today, Roberta’s condition is much improved from her ED presentation: the pulmonary oedema has resolved and she continues to make a steady recovery. Your consultant asks you to review Roberta’s medicines and to discuss how they could be optimised to enable better management of her heart failure.Mr Johannes Kepler is a 69-year-old male who underwent a hemicolectomy for carcinoma of the descending colon. He has not yet received chemotherapy and is not neutropenic. He develops a fever and chills 3 days post-operatively. He is still nil-by-mouth and he is being maintained on intravenous fluids. On questioning, he had no focal symptoms. Examination revealed a swinging fever between 37.0°C and 38.8°C for the last 12 hours, a pulse rate of 90–100 beats per minute, a BP of 130/75 mmHg (not changed from pre-operative), a clear chest, a non-tender abdomen except around the abdominal wound but with occasional bowel sounds.

She is much improved from her initial presentation and you are reviewing her today in view of discharging her home. However, on your ward round, Livia asks for help, as she feels her heart racing. You note that her pulse is rapid and irregular. An electrocardiogram (ECG) confirms AF at a rate of 130 beats/min. There are two heart sounds with no murmur appreciated. After your team reviews Livia, the consultant makes a diagnosis of non-valvular AF and prescribes a beta-blocker to provide rate control. The team also reviews possible causes of AF but does not find any particular precipitant on history or examination. Your consultant asks you to consider appropriate stroke risk reduction for Livia.Your first patient today is 42-year-old Maria Pappas, who asks for your help with her low back pain.

As she has had diabetes for 8 years, with macrovascular and microvascular complications, her target would be less stringent than the general target and would be set at 58 mmol/mol (< 7.5%).The nursing staff ask you to review Rita Wilson, a 40-year-old woman who had an open cholecystectomy 20 hours ago and who is asking for something for her pain and nausea.Connie Anderson is a 35-year-old woman who is returning to see you to discuss her pathology results.

He presented with general ‘unwellness’ reduced energy, sleep disturbance, moodiness, fighting with his peers, arguing with his family and needing prompting to complete his school work. Following your assessment of Max you suggested that he see the school counsellor for ongoing support. You asked Max to return in 2 weeks to see you but he didn’t keep the appointment. Now, 2 years later, 17–year–old Max returns with his mother – she is again expressing concern for his well–being. Max is an apprentice motor mechanic and his mother is fearful that he may lose his apprenticeship. He is binge drinking with his mates most weekends but denies using any other illicit substances.

Roberta has been admitted from the emergency department (ED) to the the medical ward. At presentation to the ED, Roberta underwent a chest X-ray that showed pulmonary oedema. Blood tests revealed that cardiac enzymes were within normal limits and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was unchanged when compared to her last recording. Roberta’s medical records indicate an echocardiogram performed 12 months ago showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 40%, increased systolic and diastolic volumes, and ventricular and atrial enlargement consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. Ischaemic heart disease is thought to be the underlying cause of Roberta’s cardiomyopathy. Today, Roberta’s condition is much improved from her ED presentation: the pulmonary oedema has resolved and she continues to make a steady recovery. Your consultant asks you to review Roberta’s medicines and to discuss how they could be optimised to enable better management of her heart failure.Mr Johannes Kepler is a 69-year-old male who underwent a hemicolectomy for carcinoma of the descending colon.

On questioning, he had no focal symptoms. Examination revealed a swinging fever between 37.0°C and 38.8°C for the last 12 hours, a pulse rate of 90–100 beats per minute, a BP of 130/75 mmHg (not changed from pre-operative), a clear chest, a non-tender abdomen except around the abdominal wound but with occasional bowel sounds.

The peripheral intravenous cannula site was red and tender.Mrs Livia Czaplinski is an 86-year-old woman who was admitted to hospital 2 days ago with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She is much improved from her initial presentation and you are reviewing her today in view of discharging her home. However, on your ward round, Livia asks for help, as she feels her heart racing. You note that her pulse is rapid and irregular. An electrocardiogram (ECG) confirms AF at a rate of 130 beats/min. There are two heart sounds with no murmur appreciated. After your team reviews Livia, the consultant makes a diagnosis of non-valvular AF and prescribes a beta-blocker to provide rate control. The team also reviews possible causes of AF but does not find any particular precipitant on history or examination. Your consultant asks you to consider appropriate stroke risk reduction for Livia.Your first patient today is 42-year-old Maria Pappas, who asks for your help with her low back pain.

About five years ago Winston started feeling pain in his lower back and went to see his GP. As the pain was thought to be associated with years of standing for many hours in front of his easel, Winston's GP referred him to an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist. For the past 3 years, changes to support his posture while painting, in conjunction with paracetamol and ibuprofen as required, have been effective in controlling the non-specific low back pain. At this appointment, Winston reports that increasing pain is distracting him from his work and making simple daily tasks, such as moving his easel and walking to the nearby wine bar, increasingly difficult.Anne Gina, a 78-year-old woman, is planned for discharge home tomorrow after making a good recovery from community-acquired pneumonia.

Roberta has been admitted from the emergency department (ED) to the the medical ward. At presentation to the ED, Roberta underwent a chest X-ray that showed pulmonary oedema.
