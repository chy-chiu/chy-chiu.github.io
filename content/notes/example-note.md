# Quick Note

This is an example of a short note. Notes are meant for shorter, less formal content compared to writing posts.

## Key Points

- Notes appear in the `/notes/` section
- They support all the same markdown features as writing posts
- Perfect for quick thoughts, summaries, or learning notes

## Code Example

```python
# Quick example
print("Notes support code too!")
```

That's it! Keep notes short and focused on a single topic or idea.
