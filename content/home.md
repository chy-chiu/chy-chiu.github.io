I am a PhD student at University of Cambridge, advised by [Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com). Previously I practiced [medicine](tags/medicine), my research is mostly on [machine] intelligence, and my long-term interest is to upload the biological [mind]. 

More [about me], with some of my recent [writing] and select [research] below.


<!-- I believe intelligence emerges from interaction between the components of a complex system. My research asks how groups of AI agents can communicate, reason, and become more than the sum of their parts. -->
