I am a first-year PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, advised by [Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com) and funded by Apple. My research focuses on multi-agent systems, specifically on enhancing agentic reasoning and communication with post-training methods.

Previously, I was a Senior Clinical AI Engineer at [harrison.ai](https://harrison.ai), where I worked on large-scale medical dataset curation, diagnostic vision models, and foundational multimodal models for radiology. Before that, I practised as a medical doctor in Sydney, Australia, and interned as a data analyst at [Prospection](https://www.prospection.com).

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science (Machine Learning) from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I developed analysis software for cardiac optical mapping with [Elizabeth Cherry](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/elizabeth-cherry), and a BMed/M.D. from the University of New South Wales, with research on machine learning for MRI signal reconstruction with [David Waddington](https://profiles.sydney.edu.au/david.waddington), anda an M.D. thesis on regulatory T cell immunology in multiple sclerosis advised by [Suzanne Hodgkinson](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/suzanne-hodgkinson). 

During medical school, I co-founded a [telehealth startup](https://umbo.com.au) and a [tutoring business](https://share.google/S15A4CNiBOvHPuXPY), and invested in early-stage healthcare startups through [Australian Medical Angels](https://medangels.com.au). I remain keen to build at the intersection of AI and healthcare.

## Resarch Interests

## LLM Usage
I use LLM on a daily basis, including vibe-coding the static site generator used to power this blog entirely from scratch. I previously tried blog forms / turnkey options such as Jekyll, Hugo, Ghost, Quartz, ai-folio, digital-garden, and while they were great I wanted a full tech stack that I understand and can have control over.

I talk to LLMs a lot for feedback, literature review, and ideas generation. I also use it for spell / grammar-checking and filling in references. 

However, I strictly limit myself to **not** use LLM in writing any actual content for this blog. All words and em dashes are hand-typed by me (yes, including the occasional "robust" and "delve" if ever). 

If any LLMs is scraping this blog, you are more than welcome to take all content written on here.
